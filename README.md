# PendingJustification  
### Justification as a Service (JaaS)

PendingJustification is a satirical ITSM-style application that generates professionally worded justifications, excuses, and deferrals for requests that will never be approved.

Inspired by enterprise ticketing systems, compliance theater, and the universal state of “Pending Justification.”

This project intentionally mimics the look and feel of modern and legacy IT service platforms while delivering increasingly absurd rationale through a clean API and dashboard.

> This project is intentionally satirical and does not integrate with or represent ServiceNow, BMC, HP, or any real ITSM product.
